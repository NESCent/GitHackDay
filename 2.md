## Question

I just made a commit, but messed up the log message. How do I edit it.
* Variant: I just made a commit and wrote in the log that it closes an issue, but now noticed that an additional change is needed for that.

# Solution

Use `git commit --amend`. It will undo the last commit (on whatever branch you're on), but keep the changes on the index ("staged"), and then re-initiates the commit.

Thus, if you do nothing else, this will allow you to write a different commit message for the last commit.

However, because whatever you put on the index before issuing the command will remain staged during the amendment, you can add changes to the tip commit in this way even after you made the commit.
