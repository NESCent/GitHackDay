## Question
I accidentally put a bunch of changes into one commit that are unrelated and should go into different commits instead. Or, how do I dissect a commit after it's been done. (A)

[This Stackexchange article](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/927358/undo-last-git-commit) has this:
"For the lightest touch, you can even undo your commit but leave your files and your index:
    git reset --soft HEAD~1
This not only leaves your files alone, it even leaves your index alone. When you do git status, you'll see that the same files are in the index as before. In fact, right after this command, you could do git commit and you'd be redoing the same commit you just had."
