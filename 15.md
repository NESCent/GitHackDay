**15. I performed a reset or a rebase and I lost an important commit by mistake. How do I get it back?**

Commits are objects in the Git repository. If they're not referenced by
any branch, they're "dangling".

1. Run ```git fsck --lost-found``` to see dangling objects. Look for dangling
commits and the corresponding SHA hash.

2. Alternatively, if you made the dangling commit you are looking for, run
```git reflog``` for a log of all the branches and commits you have edited
recently. SHA hashes are in the first column.

3. Once you have the SHA hash, check it out using ```git checkout *SHA hash*```.
You can save this commit into a new branch (using ```git checkout -b *new branch name*```),
or you can merge the commit into an exising branch (using ```git merge```).

4. Now you have a branch that ends with your long-lost commit, merge it or rebase
as you wish.

5. Garbage collection (```git gc```) may removed dangling objects; by default, it only
deletes objects more than two weeks old. Similarily, reflogs are stored for a default
of 90 days before being garbage collected.
