## Questions ##
I want to revert a commit, or a series of commits. (A)
Variant 1: It's fine or even desirable for this to be documented in the revision history.
Variant 2: I want this to disappear from the commit history. I haven't pushed the branch yet on which the commit(s) is/are.
Variant 3: Same as #2, but I have pushed up the branch, and I'm afraid others have already pulled from it. (Discussion)

## Answers ##

### git revert --help ###
Given one or more existing commits, revert the changes that the related patches
introduce, and record some new commits that record them. This requires your working
tree to be clean (no modifications from the HEAD commit).

Note: git revert is used to record some new commits to reverse the effect of some
earlier commits (often only a faulty one). If you want to throw away all
uncommitted changes in your working directory, you should see git-reset(1),
particularly the --hard option. If you want to extract specific files as they were
in another commit, you should see git-checkout(1), specifically the git checkout
<commit> -- <filename> syntax. Take care with these alternatives as both will
discard uncommitted changes in your working directory.
